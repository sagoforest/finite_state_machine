# FSM in C

## Overview
This is very much a simplistic yet more OO approach to a FSM in C.

The objective here was for a full stack SW and algorithm developer ("ahem" like myself :wink: ) to try and implement a simple FSM that can be reused built for some configuration file specifying the dependency graph.

## Testing

There are currently no unit tests.
